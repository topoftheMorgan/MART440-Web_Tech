            My name is Morgan Bowman and i am curently a junior in 
            the Media Arts program. My main focus is animation and design. 
            I curently work with motion graphics for KPCN on campus.

            When it comes to code, I know the bare basics. My senior year of highschool, I self taught my self Python,
            but I only remember the turtle function. The only experiance I have with html and CSS coding
            are the classes I have thaken in the past. Unfortunetly, since i don't use code in my
            everyday life I don't remember a lot of the styleistic code. I have learned that if I have an exapmle
            to refer to, I can make something that works and looks nice.

            Even though my major is Media Arts, I love to do a lot of physicl type of art; especially sewing.
            when i am not in school (mainly the summer) I sell plushies that I sew together at different farmers 
            marets in and around Butte Montana.
