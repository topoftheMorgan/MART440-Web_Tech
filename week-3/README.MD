I really loved the idea of this assignment and got it set up without much trouble. When I go to making the buttons functional I almost had a melt down. I was comparing my code to the example on the class website and other sources and could not figure out what was wrong. I eventually went and asked for some help and we figured it out. Some of my JavaScript lines were either missing the .innerHTML command or had it in the slightly wrong spot. After we figured that out it was smooth sailing and fun writing form there.
